                👋 Hi there! I am a recent Software Engineering Graduate from
                San Jose State University with specialization in Enterprise
                Software Technologies and cross specialization in Data Science
                📊🤖📈.

              <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
                As a versatile Software Engineer with 'Agile Mindset', I bring
                over 4 years of experience in Full Stack application development
                and Microservice architecture. My cross-specialization in Data
                Science has deepened my understanding of data-driven solutions.
                I am eager to expand my skill set in ML/AI to build AI-powered
                solutions that have global impact.

              <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
                I enjoy the challenge of developing sophisticated software and
                learning new coding skills. I thrive working in team oriented
                environments and believe that best solutions come from working
                with other programmers and developers to meet common goal. I
                enjoy writing reusable, less buggy codes. 👩‍💻💻
